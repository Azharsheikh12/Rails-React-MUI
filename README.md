### **Access the application:**
Open your web browser and go to:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## **Signup & Login through API:**

### **Endpoints:**

#### **Signup API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "newuser@example.com",
      "password": "newpassword",
      "password_confirmation": "newpassword"
    }
  }'
